          Act I begins amid a storm where 3 witches come together during the
          Scottish-Norwegian conflict. This is from what is mentioned in the
          first line: “Thunder and Lightning. Enter Three Witches”. They agree
          to meet again after the battle, which they refer to as “hurlyburly”, a
          word which means “commotion” or “uproar”. There they will meet Macbeth
          upon the heath. Then they are called by their familiars (witches
          attendants), with one being a toad (Paddock) and another being a cat
          (Graymalkin). This is evident from the lines: “I come graymalkin,
          Paddock calls: –anon!”. Before disappearing, they say their common
          phrase “Fair is foul, and foul is fair”, this is a paradox showing the
          witches morality for doing something foul in the name of justice.

        <Header as="h2">Scene II</Header>
        <p>
          Scene II starts by introducing many important characters: King Duncan,
          the king of Scotland, Malcolm and Donalbain, the sons of the king, and
          finally Lennox. They gather around a bleeding sergeant from Duncan's
          army. The bleeding sergeant reports that a Scottish traitor named
          Macdonwald gathered soldiers from the western isles ( referring to
          Ireland ) and started a revolt. This is found in the lines: “The
          merciless Macdonwald– Worthy to be a rebel, for that The multiplying
          villainies of nature Do swarm upon him– from the western isles of
          kerns and gallowglasses”. But even those forces were no match for
          brave Macbeth, he fought his way through Macdonwalds forces and
          unseam'd him with his head displayed as a trophy on the battlefield.
          But as soon as Macbeth had defeated Macdonwalds forces, a fresh
          assault began with the help of the Norweyan lord and the traitor,
          Thane of Cawdor. This worries king Duncan as he says: “Dismay’d not
          this our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?”, but the bleeding sergeant
          responds and tells him of how fiercely Macbeth and Banquo fought with
          now double the power. Then two Scottish Thanes arrive, Ross and Angus.
          They add in more detail about how bravely and fiercely Macbeth fought
          against the Norwegians and traitor forces. Ross also informs the king
          that the Thane of Cawdor betrayed the Scottish army, the king orders
          the execution of the Thane immediately and gives his former title to
          worthy Macbeth. We find this in the last few lines of scene 2: “go
          pronounce his present death, And with his former title greet Macbeth”.

        <Header as="h2">Scene III</Header>
        <p>
          Scene III starts with the witches meeting up on the heath as they had
          planned previously. While the witches wait for Macbeth they recall one
          of their mischievous recent acts. The story starts with one of the
          witches asking a sailor’s wife for chestnuts, the wife taunts the
          witch and tells her to leave. In payback, the witch tortures the
          sailor by making him not able to sleep for 81 weeks. This act against
          the sailor is evident from the line: “He shall live a man forbid: Wear
          se’nnight nine-time nine Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine” Then
          Macbeth and Banquo enter the scene, Banquo is the first to comment
          about the witches' appearances by describing them as not looking like
          the inhabitants of the earth, but yet being on it. He also comments
          about their femininity based on their lips and beards. Macbeth then
          confronts the witches and orders them to talk. The witches talk and
          hail Macbeth as the Thane of Glamis, Thane of Cawdor, and soon to be
          king hereafter : “All hail, Macbeth. Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis.
          All hail, Macbeth. Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor. All hail, Macbeth,
          that shalt be king hereafter.” Macbeth is reluctant to speak, but
          Banquo starts to speak about the state that Macbeth is in, that he
          seems to fear things that sound far off. Then he continues and asks
          the witches about his future. The witches reply and tell him that he
          will not be a king, but his sons will be kings : “Thou shalt get
          kings, though thou be none. So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo” This
          encounter not only leaves Macbeth rapt but he is also confused as the
          Thane of Cawdor lives. He begs for the witches to stay, but they
          vanish, “As breath into the wind” Macbeth quotes. Macbeth and Banquo
          wondered if they were in their right sense, they then comment on each
          other's prophecy. Then Suddenly Ross and Angus Appear, and they give
          him the happy news of his new title as Thane of Cawdor. Banquo and
          Macbeth are shocked and wonder if those witches spoke the truth.
          Macbeth goes aside and wonders that since two of the witches'
          prophecies had come true, then maybe the third prophecy of being king
          might not be far off. But as the thought of king Duncans murder comes
          to his mind, he becomes to feel nervous as if his heart knocks at his
          ribs. But then he wonders again, that may be chance will have it that
          he’ll become king without doing anything. Then as he comes back to
          reality; he orders them to go toward the king.

        <Header as="h2">Scene IV</Header>
        <p>
          Scene IV starts with King Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, and Lennox
          waiting for the arrival of Banquo and worthy Macbeth. As they wait,
          King Duncan asks his eldest son, Malcolm, if the execution on Cawdor
          has been done. Malcolm informs his father that the execution has taken
          place, and peculiarly he died honourably and confessed to his treason.
          Then Macbeth, Banquo, Ross, and Angus enter the scene, the King is
          delighted to see Macbeth and expresses his gratitude. Macbeth responds
          with what sounds like a practised speech in an attempt of impressing
          the king. The King then gives no less credit to Banquo and shows his
          gratitude, to which Banquo replies: “There if I grow, The harvest is
          your own”. The king also presents the promotion of his eldest son
          Malcolm as the Prince of Cumberland and soon to be King. The King
          continues and invites himself over to Macbeth's house, to which
          Macbeth replies humbly by saying: “I’ll be myself the harbinger, and
          make joyful The hearing of my wife with your approach;”. But we soon
          get to see Macbeth's inner thoughts as he goes aside, he expresses his
          demeanour of becoming king and sees Malcolm as an Obstacle on which he
          might fall or leap. But Macbeth fears his desires and doesn’t want
          anyone else to know, and neither does he want to see his hand kill the
          King. This is shown perfectly in the following lines: “Stars, hide
          your fires; Let no light see my black and deep desires: The eye wink
          at the hand; yet let that be Which the eye fears, when it is done to
          see.”

        <Header as="h2">Scene V</Header>
        <p>
          Scene V begins with Lady Macbeth reading her husband's letter, in the
          letter Macbeth tells her about how 3 witches predict Macbeth's
          promotion of becoming Thane of Cawdor, and also prophesied of him
          becoming King hereafter. After finishing the letter, Lady Macbeth
          reveals her thoughts about her husband not having the grit to commit
          morally wrong sins, such as murder. She believes that his nature is
          too full of kindness and without ambition, but she thinks that she’ll
          find a way to push him into becoming the king. In midst of her
          thoughts, a messenger enters and tells her that Duncan is on his way
          to her house and that he will attend till morrow. She considers this
          to be good news. As soon as the messenger exits, she is poisoned by
          her evil ambitions. She calls upon spirits to unsex her and make her
          not feel remorse. In this context, by “unsex” she means that she
          wishes to be a man and get rid of her feminine qualities. She wants no
          remorse and yo be able to perform the cruel act of murdering king
          Duncan. With the continuation of her speech, her evil morality is
          evident as she wants to rid her feminine qualities. She wants demons
          to take her milk and replace them with gall, getting rid of another
          motherly quality. Then she goes on to express her feelings about
          murder, she doesn’t want any guilty conscience nor does she want
          anyone to witness her doing the henious crime. This is evident from
          the following lines: “Come, thick night, And pall thee in the dunnest
          smoke of hell, That my keen knife see not the wound it makes, Nor
          heaven peep through the blanket of the dark, To cry ‘Hold, hold!’”
          Macbeth finally arrives home and confirms what the messenger had told
          her. Duncan will come tonight and he will leave tomorrow. She replies
          this and says “O, never shall sun that morrow see”, meaning that they
          will kill him tonight and the day he shall leave will never come. She
          is very straightforward and commanding towards Macbeth and instructs
          him to not look suspicious, an example of this is when she says: “look
          like the innocent flower, But be the serpent under’t”. The scene
          finishes off with Lady Macbeth saying: “Leave all the rest to me”,
          meaning that she will be the one that does the murdering, and all that
          Macbeth has to do is to hide suspicion.

        <p>
          Scene VI begins with King Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Banquo, Lennox,
          Macduff, Ross, and Angus arriving at Macbeth's castle. King Duncan
          comments about the castle saying: “This castle hath a pleasant seat”,
          following with Banquo saying: “This guest of summer, The
          temple-haunting martlet, does approve”. This is an example of very
          obvious dramatic irony since the audience already knows about the evil
          spirits Lady Macbeth had called on, as well as when Lady Macbeth had
          said: “Come, thick night, And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell”.
          Lady Macbeth then arrives to greet the King, the King thanks Lady
          Macbeth for all their troubles, completely oblivious to their secret
          plan. Lady Macbeth replies humbly and says what an honour it is for
          the King to attend to their house, this is in complete contrast to her
          inner thoughts and what she had said before. King Duncan also wonders
          where Macbeth is and optimistically believes that Macbeth returned
          home fast as a show of love to the king, completely oblivious of the
          fact that he was scheming. The scene ends with Lady Macbeth inviting
          the King and his men inside the Castle

        <Header as="h2">Scene VII</Header>
        <p>
          Scene VII begins with servants preparing a feast for King Duncan and
          his men. While this is going on Macbeth has a moment to himself, he
          thinks about Killing the King quickly and moving on with life. But
          Macbeths has internal conflicts about the consequences that come with
          a crime like this; he wishes that he could give up the afterlife
          (heaven) if there was no judgment for his crime. Another thing that
          comes to his mind is that King Duncan is loved by all people meaning
          that everyone would feel the pain of his death. He also thinks about
          his role as a host to King Duncan, and the honour that he had given
          him by visiting his castle. Lady Macbeth enters the scene and wonders
          why Macbeth had been in his chamber this entire time. Macbeth tells
          her that they should not proceed any further into this business. Lady
          Macbeth replies angrily towards Macbeth and taunts his masculinity,
          she calls him “Like the poor cat i” the adage?”. Macbeth responds and
          says that he is enough of a man and that being more than that will be
          a monster. Lady Macbeth responds more vigorously this time and not
          only taunts his masculinity, but also his false promises. She goes on
          to say: “How tender ‘tis to love the babe that milks me: I would,
          while smiling in my face, Have pluck’d my nipple from his boneless
          gums, And dash’d the brains out, had I sworn as you Have done to this”
          This means that she would smash the head of a baby she was
          breastfeeding if she had promised it, this is a taunt towards Macbeth
          to say that he makes hollow promises. This convinces Macbeth but he is
          still worried about getting caught. Lady Macbeth replies to this and
          tells Macbeth to man up and have the courage to do something. She then
          formulates a plan of getting the two kings guards drunk so they don’t
          remember what happens that night. She also suggests marking the guard
          with blood so that they would be framed for the killing. Macbeth
          finally agrees to the killing, they also decide to put on a show of
          being in grief so suspicions stay away from them. The scene ends with:
          “False face must hide what the false heart doth know” False face means
          that he must keep his emotions to himself, and the false heart might
          refer to Macbeth questioning his sense of morality.
