        <p>
          Act 2 begins with Banquo, and his son Fleance pondering over the dark
          night sky. Saying: “There’s husbandry in heaven”, meaning that the sky
          is saving light from the stars. This is in response to what Macbeth
          and Lady Macbeth had said in the previous Act, where they asked the
          stars to hide their fires, and also for the night to cover the sky in
          the smoke of hell. Banquo also says that he’s been having trouble
          sleeping. Macbeth enters the scene and Banquo has a hard time
          identifying him, this symbolizes that darkness has clouded Macbeth's
          appearance. Banquo continues and talks about the king's unusual
          generosity, he delivers them a diamond from the king in admiration for
          Lady Macbeth being a kind host. He also tells Macbeth about dreams of
          the three witches he’d had recently, he realizes that some of what
          they had prophesied had come true. Macbeth blocks this conversation by
          saying that he doesn’t think about them at all. Macbeth tells Banquo
          that they could discuss this idea another time and that he has ideas
          that could benefit both of them. Banquo says that he’ll do whatever
          Macbeth has in mind as long as it’s not morally wrong. Then as Banquo
          and Fleance leave, Macbeth commands his servant to tell Lady Macbeth
          to ring the bell when his drink is ready. When the servant finally
          leaves, Macbeth is left all alone with his thoughts. Out of nowhere,
          Macbeth starts to see an illusion of a dagger floating in front of
          him, with its handle pointing right toward him. He tries to clutch its
          handle but fails in doing so, he soon realizes that the dagger is just
          an illusion and that he has bloody business to attend to. This dagger
          symbolizes Macbeth's internal struggle; him being stressed about the
          killing of Duncan, a lack of sleep, and his heat-oppressed brain (
          pressure ). On his way toward the King’s chambers, he psyches himself
          out by comparing himself to evil forces. But he realizes that delaying
          time won’t do anything, the longer he waits the less he desires to
          murder the King. Then the bell finally rings, he goes in towards his
          chamber and the scene ends. Something notable about the last few lines
          is that Macbeth says: “Duncan, for it is a knell That summons thee to
          heaven, or to hell” Even though most people during Shakespeare's time
          believed that the king was divine and chosen by god, he still added
          “or to hell” in this final line. This could be Macbeth trying to
          convince himself that the murder of the king is somewhat justifiable
          because he was a bad person.

        <Header as="h2">Scene II</Header>
        <p>
          Scene II begins with Lady Macbeth waiting for her husband to come back
          when suddenly she hears commotion outside. She worries that Macbeth
          has been caught in his crime, but fortunately Macbeth comes back safe.
          Macbeth comes in shaming himself for what he had just done, Lady
          Macbeth tries to calm him down but he continues further in remorse. He
          tells her about two people he heard on his way back, one laughed in
          his sleep while on cried “murder”. Macbeth says that they later went
          to sleep and said their prayers; one said “Amen” while the other said
          “God bless us”. But in that moment Macbeth tried to repeat after them
          to say “Amen”, but he could not say “Amen”. Him not being able to say
          “Amen” shows that Macbeth feels he has committed a crime directly
          towards god. Lady Macbeth tells him to not think about it or else it
          will make them mad. Macbeth doesn’t stop, and tells her that he heard
          a voice saying : “Sleep no more! Macbeth does murder sleep”. Since
          sleep symbolizes rest and innocence, this line means that Macbeth is
          no longer innocent, nor will he be at rest carrying the heavy burden
          of murder. Lady Macbeth tells him that he is acting like a coward and
          to clean the blood off his hands. Then she notices that Macbeth
          brought the daggers back with him, their original plan was to leave it
          on the guard to frame them. She is distressed by this and orders
          Macbeth to put them back, but Macbeth is too frightened to look back
          at what he has done. So Lady Macbeth leaves by herself to plant the
          daggers on the guard. When Lady Macbeth leaves he starts to hear
          knocking, he is frightened and wonders where it is coming from. Lady
          Macbeth finally comes back with her hands bloody, the knocking
          continues again and she informs Macbeth that it’s coming from the
          south entry. She tells Macbeth to act cool and to change into his
          nightgown. But Macbeth stills feels remorse and regret of what he had
          just done and he ends the scene saying: “Wake Duncan with thy
          knocking! I would thou couldst!”

        <Header as="h2">Scene III</Header>
        <p>
          A porter hears knocking on a door, intoxicated from last night he
          pretends to be the porter of hell. He plays a game sentencing
          different types of people to hell, with one being a farmer and one an
          equivocator. He finally comes to his senses and opens the door for
          Macduff and Lennox. The porter jokes around with Macduff and tells him
          about what drinking provokes, he also jokes about drinking causing
          erectile dysfunction. Macbeth enters and Macduff asks if the king is
          awake, Macbeth EQUIVOCATES and says: “Not Yet”. He directs Macduff to
          the king's chamber, while Macduff goes to wake the king Lennox tells
          Macbeth about the supernatural weather they had been having. This
          alludes to the upcoming chaos and the disruption of the great chain of
          beings. Macduff re-enters and terrified by what he had just seen says
          : “horror, horror, horror!”. Macduff tells them of the murder of the
          king, he then rings the bells of the castle and awakes everybody.
          Macbeth gives a rehearsed speech about feeling remorse about the
          king's death and how life isn’t worth living without the king. Malcolm
          and Donalbain enter, they ask who has committed the murder. Lennox
          tells them it was the king's guards that murdered him and Macbeth
          tells them he killed both guards. Macduff questions why he would do
          that, Macbeth tells him that his love for the king was too strong and
          he wanted to get revenge. Lady Macbeth faints after hearing Macbeth
          talk, this might be because his rehearsed speech puts suspicion on
          both of them, or she wants to look innocent and faint in front of
          them. Lady Macbeth is carried out, then Macbeth and the others decide
          to meet together in the hall and discuss this. All of them leave but
          Malcolm and Donalbain, they talk with each other and decide to not
          consult with them. They are suspicious as any of them could be the
          perpetrator. So Malcolm decides to go to Ireland, and Donalbain to
          Scotland to avoid getting caught in the killer's path.

        <Header as="h2">Scene IV</Header>
        <p>
          Scene IV begins with an old man recalling the terrible and strange
          event of last night. He is with Ross and tells him that in his 70
          years he had never seen such a worse night. Ross talks about recent
          events following the king's death: An eclipse, a mousing owl killing a
          falcon, and Duncan's beautiful horses turning wild and eating each
          other. The eclipse symbolizes the darkness the death of the king has
          caused on the land, the owl killing a falcon symbolizes a low ranking
          man overtaking a higher ranking man, and the beautiful horses turning
          wild symbolizes the disruption of the chain of wild beings and also
          the dividing of people. Macduff enters the scene and tells Ross that
          the king’s two sons had fled the country, this conveniently works in
          Macbeth's favor as the sovereignty falls upon him because the king’s
          sons are absent. He also tells him that he is going home and isn’t
          going to Macbeth's coronation. This shows that Macduff doesn’t support
          Macbeth at all. Ross tells him that he will attend and support
          Macbeth, to which Macduff responds : “Let our old robes sit easier
          than our new!”. This line shows that Macduff is fearing that things
          won’t be comfortable once Macbeth is announced king.
