          In a dark cavern, the three witches circle a cauldron, chanting spells
          and adding bizarre ingredients to a stew. Macbeth enters and asks the
          witches to reveal the truth of their prophecies to him. To answer his
          question the three witches show him horrible visions that show Macbeth
          his biggest fears. First, a floating head warns him to beware of
          Macduff. Then a bloody child appears and tells him that no one woman
          born can harm him. They also show Macbeth a crowned child holding a
          tree. The child tells him that he is safe until Birnam Wood moves to
          Dunsinane Hill. Finally, a group of eight crowned kings walk by with
          the last one being Banquo's ghost. Macbeth demands to know the meaning
          of this final vision, but the witches vanish leaving him to find the
          answer on his own. At the end of the scene, Lennox finds Macbeth and
          tells him that Macduff has fled to England. In response, Macbeth sends
          murderers to Macduff Castle to kill his family.

          At Macduff’s castle, Lady Macduff questions Ross, demanding to know
          why her husband has fled. Ross insists that she trusts her husband’s
          judgment and then regretfully departs. Once he is gone, Lady Macduff
          tells her son that his father is dead, but Macduff's son doesn’t
          believe her. Suddenly, a messenger appears warning Lady Macduff that
          she is in danger and urging her to flee. Lady Macduff refuses to leave
          saying that she has done no wrong. A group of murderers then enters.
          When one of them talks down on Macduffs name, Macduff’s son calls the
          murderer a liar, and the murderer stabs him. Lady Macduff turns and
          runs, and the pack of killers chases after her and ultimately ends up
          killing her too.

          Malcolm doesn't trust Macduff so to determine whether Macduff is
          trustworthy, Malcolm rambles on about his own guilt. He admits that he
          wonders whether he is fit to be king since he claims to be lustful,
          greedy, and violent. At first, Macduff politely disagrees with his
          future king, but eventually, Macduff cannot keep himself from crying
          out, “O Scotland, Scotland!”Macduff’s loyalty to Scotland leads him to
          agree that Malcolm is not fit to govern Scotland and perhaps not even
          to live. Malcolm passes Macduff's test of loyalty by retracting the
          lies he said about his worthiness to be King. Shortly after Ross
          enters and tells Macduff that his wife and children are well. He urges
          Malcolm to return to his country. Malcolm says that he will return
          with ten thousand soldiers. When Malcolm is saying this Ross can't
          handle it and confesses to Macduff that Macbeth has murdered his wife
          and children. Macduff is crushed with grief. Malcolm urges him to turn
          his grief to anger, and Macduff assures him that he will inflict
          revenge upon Macbeth.
